# Plan: Run Project Locally

This plan outlines the steps to install dependencies and start the development server for the `hiring_tdconsulting` project.

## Proposed Changes

### Environment Setup
- Copy [.env.example](file:///e:/TDC_App/TD_Consulting_App/hiring_tdconsulting/.env.example) to `.env` to ensure the application has the necessary environment variables defined (even if values are placeholders).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `npm run dev`: Verify that the Vite development server starts without errors and provides a local URL.

### Manual Verification
- Access the application via the local URL (typically http://localhost:5173 or similar) and verify that the homepage loads correctly.
