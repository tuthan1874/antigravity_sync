# Walkthrough: Project Setup and Running

I have successfully read the project and started it locally.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Exploration**: Identified the project as a Vite-based React application with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
2.  **Environment Setup**: Copied [.env.example](file:///e:/TDC_App/TD_Consulting_App/hiring_tdconsulting/.env.example) to `.env`.
3.  **Dependency Installation**: Ran `npm install` to install all necessary packages.
4.  **Running the Project**: Started the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Current Status

The application is running locally at:
**Local**: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
**Network**: [http://192.168.1.7:8080/](http://192.168.1.7:8080/)

> [!NOTE]
> The browser subagent encountered an environment issue with Playwright, but the command line output confirms the Vite server is ready and serving the application.

## Verification

The terminal output shows:
```sh
  VITE v5.4.19  ready in 563 ms
