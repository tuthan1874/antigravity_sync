# Neomorphism UI Redesign - Login Screen Overhaul

## ✅ Redesigned Login Screen

I've completely overhauled the Login screen based on the "soft minimalist" inspiration image you provided. This design combines the tactile neomorphic foundation with a modern, artistic split-layout aesthetic.

### Key Features

1. **Split-Layout Design**:
   - **Form Side**: A clean, white area with large typography ("Create your account") and modern pill-shaped buttons.
   - **Illustration Side**: A warm, cream-colored area (`#f1eee4`) featuring an adorable 3D cartoon character.

2. **3D Character Asset**:
   - I generated a custom 3D clay-style character that matches the soft aesthetic of the inspiration image.

3. **Modern Form Elements**:
   - **Google Sign-In**: A clean pill button with the standard Google icon.
   - **Fields**: Soft borders with round corners and subtle focus states.
   - **Primary Button**: A black/dark pill button (`rounded-full`) for a premium minimalist look.

4. **Background & Container**:
   - The entire screen uses a soft beige background (`#f6f4ee`).
   - The layout is contained within a massive white card with `rounded-[40px]`.

## 🎨 Visual Results

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **AuthLayout.tsx**: Simplified to provide the global `#f6f4ee` background and centering logic.
- **SignIn.tsx**: Completely refactored with the new split-layout JSX and Tailwind classes.
- **Assets**: The 3D character was generated and placed in the project's `public` directory to ensure perfect loading.

## 📊 Project Progress

| Phase | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Design System** | ✅ Complete |
| **SignIn Page Redesign** | ✅ Complete |
| **Main App Pages** | 🔄 Pending Transformation |

The login screen now sets a very high visual bar for the rest of the application. I will continue applying this "soft minimalist" yet tactile feel to the internal pages.
