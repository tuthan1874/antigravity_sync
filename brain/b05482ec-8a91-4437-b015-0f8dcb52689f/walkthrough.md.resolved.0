# Walkthrough: UI UX Pro Max Skill Installation

I have successfully installed the **UI UX Pro Max** skill in your project.

## Changes Made

### Initialization
- Created [.agent/workflows/ui-ux-pro-max.md](file:///e:/TDC_App/UI%20UX%20max%20skill/.agent/workflows/ui-ux-pro-max.md): This file allows you to trigger the skill using the `/ui-ux-pro-max` command.
- Created `.shared/ui-ux-pro-max/`: This directory contains the design database (styles, colors, fonts, and guidelines).

## Verification Results

### File Structure Check
I have verified that the following paths exist and are populated:
- [x] `e:\TDC_App\UI UX max skill\.agent\workflows\ui-ux-pro-max.md`
- [x] `e:\TDC_App\UI UX max skill\.shared\ui-ux-pro-max\data`
- [x] `e:\TDC_App\UI UX max skill\.shared\ui-ux-pro-max\scripts`

### How to use
You can now start using the skill by typing `/ui-ux-pro-max` followed by your request. For example:
> `/ui-ux-pro-max Build a landing page for my SaaS product`

The AI will automatically use the design intelligence from the database to provide a professional result.
