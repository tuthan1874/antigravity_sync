# Dashboard Performance Optimization Walkthrough

## Overview
This walkthrough documents the successful optimization of the HRM Dashboard ([app/page.tsx](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/page.tsx)). We have transitioned from manual `useEffect`-based data fetching to `swr` (Stale-While-Revalidate) for improved performance, caching, and background updates.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Caching with SWR
- **Dependency**: Installed `swr` package.
- **Provider**: Created [components/providers/swr-provider.tsx](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/components/providers/swr-provider.tsx) with global configuration:
  - `revalidateOnFocus: false` (Prevents unnecessary re-fetches when switching tabs/windows).
  - `shouldRetryOnError: false`.
- **Integration**: Wrapped the application in [SWRProvider](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/components/providers/swr-provider.tsx#6-19) within [app/layout.tsx](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/layout.tsx).

### 2. Dashboard Refactoring ([app/page.tsx](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/page.tsx))
- **HRDashboard**:
  - Replaced `useState` and `useEffect` with a single `useSWR` hook.
  - Moved data fetching logic (Employees, Departments, Attendance, Balance, Notifications, Stats Calculation) into the SWR fetcher function.
  - Implemented data caching with `dedupingInterval: 60000` (1 minute).
  - Cleaned up duplicate state variables and unused imports.
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and ensured type safety where possible.
  - Exposed `attendanceData` and `notifications` from the hook for rendering logic.

- **EmployeeDashboard**:
  - Replaced `useState` and `useEffect` with `useSWR`.
  - Consolidated multiple API calls using `Promise.all` inside the fetcher.
  - Added proper error handling and fallback values.
  - Removed unused variables (`loading`, `t`) and imports.

### 3. Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `lucide-react` icons and `recharts` components to reduce bundle size.
- Removed unused React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Fixed syntax errors (extra braces) and potential runtime errors (undefined date formatting).

## Storage Migration to Cloudflare R2

### 1. Setup
- **Dependencies**: `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`.
- **Implementation**: Created [lib/r2.ts](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/lib/r2.ts) for strictly-typed and secure interaction with R2 (S3-compatible).

### 2. API Routes
- **Generic Upload**: [app/api/storage/upload/route.ts](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/api/storage/upload/route.ts) - Handles generic file uploads (used by avatars).
- **Generic Delete**: [app/api/storage/delete/route.ts](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/api/storage/delete/route.ts) - Handles file deletion.
- **Expense Upload**: [app/api/expense-requests/upload/route.ts](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/api/expense-requests/upload/route.ts) - Updated to use R2.
- **Employee Documents**: `app/api/employees/[id]/documents/route.ts` - Updated upload, list, and delete logic to use R2.
- **Signed URLs**: [app/api/storage/sign-url/route.ts](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/app/api/storage/sign-url/route.ts) - Updated to generate R2 presigned URLs.

### 3. Client & Utilities
- **Avatars**: [lib/avatar-utils.ts](file:///e:/TDC_App/TDGAMES_App/HRM/source/lib/avatar-utils.ts) updated to route storage operations through the new API endpoints, keeping R2 credentials secure on the server.
- **Environment**: Depends on `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL`.

## Verification Results
- **Syntax Check**: All syntax errors resolved.
- **Type Safety**: Critical type errors resolved; remaining `any` types are non-blocking.
- **Render Logic**: Verified that data structures returned by SWR match the component's rendering requirements (e.g., `attendanceData` for charts, `notifications` list).
- **Browser Verification**: Failed to launch automated browser environment. User verification required on `localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps
- Monitor dashboard performance in production.
- Consider further backend query optimizations if payload size becomes an issue (e.g., selecting specific columns).
- **Migration**: Manually migrate existing files from Supabase Storage to R2 bucket if needed (preserving paths).
