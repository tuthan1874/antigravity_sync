# Walkthrough - Spine Animation Portfolio

I have successfully built the Portfolio Animation Spine Website. The application allows you to upload Spine exports (.zip), organizes them in a gallery, and lets you view the animations using the official Spine Web Player.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Project Initialization
- **Stack**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Architecture**: Client-side only, using IndexedDB for storage.

### 2. Storage Layer
- **IndexedDB**: Used `idb-keyval` to store large blobs (images, atlases, JSONs).
- **Service**: `storageService` handles saving, retrieving, and listing projects.
- **Hooks**: [useProjects](file:///e:/TDC_App/Portfolio_GG/src/hooks/useProjects.ts#5-55) hook manages the state and loading of projects.

### 3. Upload & Parsing
- **ZIP Parser**: `parserService` extracts [.json](file:///e:/TDC_App/Portfolio_GG/package.json) (or `.skel`), `.atlas`, and `.png` files from uploaded ZIPs.
- **Validation**: Ensures all required files are present before saving.
- **UI**: Drag & Drop zone with visual feedback.

### 4. Gallery & Viewer
- **Gallery**: Grid layout displaying uploaded projects.
- **Viewer**: integrated `@esotericsoftware/spine-player` to render animations.
- **Asset Handling**: Dynamically creates Blob URLs for the Spine Player to load assets from IndexedDB.

## How to Verify

1. **Start the App**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Open Browser**: Go to `http://localhost:5173`.
3. **Upload**:
   - Prepare a ZIP file containing a Spine export (e.g., `hero.json`, `hero.atlas`, `hero.png`).
   - Drag and drop it into the upload zone.
4. **View**:
   - Click "View" on the project card.
   - The Spine Player should load and play the animation.
5. **Persistence**:
   - Refresh the page. The project should still be there.

## Next Steps
- Add thumbnail generation (currently uses a placeholder or requires manual implementation).
- Add more robust error handling for complex Spine versions.
- Implement "Delete" confirmation.
