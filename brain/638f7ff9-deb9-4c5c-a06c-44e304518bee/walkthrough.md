# Walkthrough: TD Games Portfolio Setup

I have successfully cloned and set up the TD Games Portfolio project.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Cloning**: Cloned the repository from `https://github.com/TDSolutionsHN/tdgames_porfolio.git`.
2.  **Tech Stack Identification**:
    *   **Framework**: Next.js 16.0.8 (App Router)
    *   **Core**: React 19, TypeScript
    *   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
    *   **Icons**: Lucide React, Font Awesome
3.  **Dependency Installation**:
    *   Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to handle peer dependency conflicts between React 19 and `vaul`.
4.  **Running the Project**:
    *   Started the development server using `npm run dev`.
    *   Verified the application is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Verification Results

The application is running correctly on `http://localhost:3000`. The landing page loads with the TD Games hero section and service descriptions.
